  caveats <<~EOS
    Radiouploader is not signed with an Apple Developer ID, and Homebrew marks
    what it downloads, so macOS will refuse the first launch. Take the mark off:

      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine #{appdir}/Radiouploader.app

    Or leave it, let macOS block the app once, and allow it in System Settings ->
    Privacy & Security (on macOS 14 and earlier, Control-click -> Open).

    The app never tells you your images are clean: it looks for burnt-in text
    before anonymising and rings what it finds, but it misses small print and
    text over anatomy. Look at every frame yourself, and read
    https://gmadevs.github.io/Radiouploader/limitations first.
